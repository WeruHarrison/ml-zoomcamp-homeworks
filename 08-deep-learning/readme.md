# Homework 08 – Deep Learning


This repo contains my solution and reflection for **Module 8 – Deep Learning** of the [Machine Learning Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp/tree/master/08-deep-learning) by Datatalks Club led by Alexey Grigorev.

The goal of the homework was to understand how machine learning models are deployed so that they can be used for inference across different machines or applications without rerunning the entire training workflow. This module marked a transition from model experimentation to production-oriented thinking.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

* TensorFlow / Keras
* PyTorch
* ONNX (for exporting the final model)

## 🧩 What I Did

The module began with a TensorFlow/Keras workflow, where we learned how to do tranfer learning on existing models and saved it for inference. Later, the approach shifted to **PyTorch**, where we repeated the entire training-to-inference pipeline using a different framework. Finally, I learned how to export the trained PyTorch model to **ONNX** for serveless deployment. In the homework, I used PyTorch entirely. I started the activity with downloading a zip file of the data and then unzipped it. I then pre-processed the data before initial training. I then trained a second model after augmentation.

## Final Thoughts

The module gave the basics of deep learning. There are a lot of things that were touched on briefly. Its suitable for beginners but additional resources are required to have a better understanding of deep learning models and applying them in practice. All in all, it was worth participating.
