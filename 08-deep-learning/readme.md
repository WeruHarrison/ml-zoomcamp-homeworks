# Homework 08 – Deep Learning


This repo contains my solution and reflection for **Module 8 – Deep Learning** of the [Machine Learning Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp/tree/master/08-deep-learning) by Datatalks Club led by Alexey Grigorev.

The goal of the homework was to understand the basics of deep learning. It was to give a general overview of deep learning models and how to develop them from already created models.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

* TensorFlow / Keras
* PyTorch
* ONNX (for exporting the final model)

## 🧩 What I Did

The module began with a TensorFlow/Keras workflow, where we learned how to do tranfer learning on existing models and saved it for inference. Later, the approach shifted to **PyTorch**, where we repeated the entire training-to-inference pipeline using a different framework. Finally, I learned how to export the trained PyTorch model to **ONNX** for serveless deployment. In the homework, I used PyTorch entirely. I started the activity with downloading a zip file of the data and then unzipped it. I then pre-processed the data before initial training. I then trained a second model after augmentation.

## Final Thoughts

The module gave the basics of deep learning. There are a lot of things that were touched on briefly. Its suitable for beginners but additional resources are required to have a better understanding of deep learning models and applying them in practice. All in all, it was worth participating.
