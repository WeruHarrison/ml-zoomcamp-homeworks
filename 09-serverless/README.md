# Homework 09 – Serverless

This repo contains my solution and reflection for [Module 9 – Serverless](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp/tree/master/09-serverless) of the [Machine Learning Zoomcamp](https://courses.datatalks.club/ml-zoomcamp-2025/) by Datatalks Club led by [Alexey Grigorev](https://www.linkedin.com/in/agrigorev/). The module was about deploying deep learning models in the cloud, AWS Lambda specifically. It also touched on creating web APIs that can be used to interact with the deep learning models.
